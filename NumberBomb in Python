#Number Bomb is a guessing game where a secret number between 1 and 100 is randomly chosen. 
#You and the computer take turns guessing numbers within a changing range. 
#After each guess, the range updates to help narrow down the bombâ€™s location. 
#If someone guesses the bomb number, they lose that round. The first to win three rounds wins the whole game.
